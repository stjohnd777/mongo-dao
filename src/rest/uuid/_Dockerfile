# The first thing we need to do is define from what image we want to build from.
# Here we will use the latest LTS (long term support) version 14 of node available
# from the Docker Hub:
FROM node:14

# Next we create a directory to hold the application code inside the image,
# this will be the working directory for your application:
# Create app directory
# WORKDIR /usr/src/app


# This image comes with Node.js and NPM already installed so the next
# thing we need to do is to install your app dependencies using the npm binary.
# Please note that if you are using npm version 4 or earlier a package-lock.json
# file will not be generated.

# Install app dependencies
# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
# where available (npm@5+)
COPY ../../../package*.json  .

RUN npm install
# If you are building your code for production
# RUN npm ci --only=production



# To bundle your app's source code inside the Docker image, use the COPY instruction:
# Bundle app source
COPY  ../../../*  .
